# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw it or Lose it which is currently only available on Android. It is a game that will consist of four rounds, one minute each, drawings are rendered from a large library of stock drawings as clues and the team has to guess before the time expires. The drawing is rendered at a steady rate reaching teh completed picture by the 30 second mark.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The third page of the documentation which discuesses the "Executive Summary", "Design Constraints", "system Architecture View", and the "Domain Model" I feel I developed the best. I feel with my buisness background being able to identify the key components the clients want implemented and being able to translate their needs into this document suited me. Also having a larger point of view of the project discussing the design constraints before delving deep into the actual project I feel I could also identify pretty well. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Being able to see a layout of the software and the clients needs before coding is very useful because it helps you stay on track with the main focus for the project and not get lost while developing. Also the document talks about the operating systems that would work best in what scenarios with their reasonings so that also helps you layout exactly what you want to use for certain scenarios.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The table is where I lacked good information for each operating system. I would revise it by adding more detail about the different applications that each offer, their storage management, memory management, and be more specific on the security aspects of each operating system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The best way to interupt user needs in my opinion is developing user stories. user stories help put in a logical format exactly the output the user is describing that they would like to see in the software. this format helps the development team, put together test cases and stay on track with why this feature is being added and what it is expected to do. Listening to user's is the most important aspect of designing because they are who you are designing for. Without user's your software would not grow or be profitable so listening to what they need is the best and easiest way to make sure that the features you are adding are being put in place to help the software grow, be more profitable, and help your playerbase in this case stay happy with the product. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think the biggest thing I learned is that preperation before designing is an important, and neccesary step in developing software. Filling out this design document, alongside creating user stories, and test cases, really allows for you to have everything laid out for the project to put you and your team in a great position to make important decisions on how you want to apporach the product. When everything is decicded, these doucments act as a guide and reference to help you stay on track when actually developing the software.
